#### ERP Research
1. Based on what we saw on those sheets:
	1. what are the available options?
	2. paid services vs open source solutions?
	3. Scope of the proposed solution


#### SagarA Notes
Tried to look for available open source ERP solutions. Search terms: `ERP open source`, `ERP self hosted`, `ERP solutions` etc. 
Potential Solutions:
1. https://erpnext.com/ (ERPNext)
	1. Open source solution with a paid cloud offering
	2. Demo available with some sample data 
2. TODO:
	1. Data from AmarAlum Sheet can fit in ERPNext?
	2. AmarAlum workflows can be defined in ERPNext?
	3. Missing things in ERPNext?
